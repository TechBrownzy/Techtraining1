HTTP is the standard protocol by which webpages are transferred over the Internet
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links
An HTTP request is the way Internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website. Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information
An HTTP response is what web clients (often browsers) receive from an Internet server in answer to an HTTP request. These responses communicate valuable information based on what was asked for in the HTTP request
