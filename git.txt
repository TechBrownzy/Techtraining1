Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools
Git operates on the principle of creating snapshots or "commits" of your code at different stages, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed
